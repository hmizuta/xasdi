### Discussions
- Nothing for now


### Notes
- We have AWSOM approval for open source.

- We have the final approval by Yoshihama-san.

- We published XASDI as open source (https://github.com/x10-lang/xasdi) on March 8. The baseline is https://git.sl.cloud9.ibm.com/XAXIS/xasdi/commits/move-to-github. We copied files from the internal repository to the external repository. We did't copy their metadata such as commit logs. The internal repository was archived and read-only.

- We published XASDI homepage (http://x10-lang.org/xasdi/) on March 15. Currently it is just a placeholder so it must be updated by the announcement.

- We will use GitHub issues for report bugs by end users.

- The version number for the next release will be v0.9.0.
